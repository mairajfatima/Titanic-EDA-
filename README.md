# Titanic - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project is part of the Elevopathway internship, where I performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal of this project was to understand the data, uncover patterns, and gain insights that could help predict survival chances.

## 📁 Dataset Source

- [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)

## 🔍 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis
- Visualize relationships between features and survival rate
- Highlight key findings and insights

## 📊 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📌 Key Insights

- Women had a higher survival rate compared to men
- Passengers in higher classes (1st class) had better survival chances
- Children (under age 10) had a relatively higher survival rate
- Fare and embarkation point also showed influence on survival

## 📂 Files Included

- `Titanic_EDA.ipynb` – Jupyter Notebook with full analysis
- `README.md` – Project description
- Any visualizations or charts generated during analysis

## ✅ Status

✔️ Completed
